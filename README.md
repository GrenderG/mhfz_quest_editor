# How to use editor
Run mhfz_quest_editor.exe, and open quest file then edit as you wish.  
Note that the file should be decrypted with ReFrontier at first.  
After that push "Done!" button to save.  
I recommend you to create new file instead of overwrite original one just in case.  

# How to load custom quest
Replace original quest file with yours.  
If you want to add it as new quest you should edit event quest list file.
